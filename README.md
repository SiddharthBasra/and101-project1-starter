# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: **Siddharth Basra**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

"Hello, Squirrel!" is my very first Android application, built as an introduction to mobile development fundamentals. It takes the classic "Hello, World!" concept and applies it to a friendly neighborhood squirrel üêøÔ∏è. My main goal for this project was to get comfortable with the Android Studio environment, understand basic UI customization, and learn the essential Git workflow for managing project code.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üõ†Ô∏èüì±‚ú®

## Notes

This project was a fantastic first dive into Android development! The initial setup was a bit challenging, dealing with Gradle version incompatibilities and JVM issues, but getting past that was a great learning experience in troubleshooting.

A significant part of my learning revolved around Git. I initially struggled with push permissions because I had directly cloned the original repository instead of my own fork. Understanding the difference between `forking` and `cloning`, how to change the `remote origin` URL in my local project, and successfully pushing to my personal GitHub fork was a huge takeaway.

Overall, I gained a much clearer understanding of how Android Studio works, how resources like `strings.xml` are used for customization, and the importance of a proper Git workflow for collaboration and version control.

Regarding the "private repository" requirement, due to GitHub's limitations, a fork of a public repository cannot be made private. However, I have added `codepathreview` as a collaborator, ensuring direct access for review purposes.
